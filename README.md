## Wumpus?
Hunt the Wumpus is an early computer game, based on a simple hide and seek format featuring a mysterious monster (the Wumpus) that lurks deep inside a network of rooms. It was originally a text-based game written in BASIC. It has since been ported to various programming languages and platforms including graphical versions.

## Development

To run the simulator locally you only need **Node.js**. If Node is not installed, download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installer instructions for your operating system.

Clone the repository and start a static server from the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thiagodnf/wumpus-world-simulator.git
cd wumpus-world-simulator
npx http-server
```

After running the command above open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to play the game locally. If you prefer you can create an `npm start` script that calls `npx http-server` so that starting the server is as simple as `npm start`.

## Configuration
You can change the board size and the number of elements before starting a new game.
Use the settings tab to set the desired number of lines, columns, holes, wumpus and golds, then press **Restart** to apply.

## Languages
The Wumpus World Simulator is available at following languages:
* en-US
* pt-BR
* ar
* fr
* tr_TR

## Development

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Start a local server using:

```bash
npm start
```

This serves the app on <http://localhost:8080>.

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:
